# Protobot

This project is based off of the Phaser tutorial while I was creating my Stickdom sidecroller game
In the folder first phaser game, it is my first prototype of Stickdom in where the player collects the star and shoots bombs
In the folder Bot, it is a bot that is designed to play the Phaser game.

Currently, the bot uses template matching to run around and collect stars. Bombs have been disabled until I find a way to implement them.
To run bot the bot and the game, I recommend using Visual studio to run part1.html with python idle to run the bot. The game should be in full screen
as Pillow's imageGrab grabbed the screen in that manner.

If you want to play the game:
	Arrow keys to move and Space to shoots

Have fun!!
